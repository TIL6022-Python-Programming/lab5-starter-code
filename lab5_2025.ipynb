    "\n",
    "This lab assignment is more complicated than previous ones, in that you will have to break down the problem in to steps. This Notebook template helps you with this especially in the data preparation and result variables initialization. In the last part the challenge is to recompose your input data in to a value grid that can be meaningfully visualized and is not highly noisy. A little bit of mathematics will be involved. You will have to think at two distinct levels in this assignment:\n",
    "1. <b>High perspective</b> - For example, what steps are needed, and what products (variables) do they need from earlier steps, and provide to later steps?\n",
    "2. <b>Low perspective</b> - For example, what loop or logical statement implements a step, and what is the correct Python syntax?\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have to switch back-and-forth between these perspectives. As an aid in this process, make a <b>visualization of the design approach</b>. Print the Design Approach template image from BrightSpace, or reproduce the most important boxes and elements with pen on paper. Fill the boxes and elements pertaining to this assignment. In particular think of:\n",

    "2. Objective\n",
    "3. Constraints\n",
    "4. Design space - dimensions\n",
    "5. Conceptual design\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a simpler version of steps that might not produce the right results (e.g. all zero's, or using only a fraction of the data), but helps you to create the workflow. Apply consistency regarding the questions: for <b>speed difference</b> (dv), do you use columns or rows in the grid, and do you use loop variable `i` or `j`? Do the same for <b>headway</b> and do this consistently. Speed difference will be on the x-axis, headway will be on the y-axis, acceleration will determine color in the plot.\n"
